										<p>Hi, I am studying in Human Computer Interaction and Social Computing. My primary research interests are in computer-supported cooperative work, computer mediated communication, and social computing. In general, I have a wide range of interest in HCI. </p> 
										<p>I have the capabilities of discovering users’ needs, prototyping, doing quantitative evaluation and analyzing research data. I can find design implications by interviewing users and summarizing qualitative data. Also, I am good at cooperating with others no matter I work as an programmer or doing research, then produce lots of innovative works.</p>

											<p>
											Since experts and expertise are increasingly distributed across distance, remote collaboration on physical tasks also becomes popular. Physical collaboration requires collaborators to produce and resolve references to physical objects unambiguously. AlphaRead that enables users to add and see readable annotations of physical objects, such as labels in letter, in a dynamic video-mediated workspace.
											<br><br><b>Result: </b>By making objects referable with readable labels, we improved the communication efficiency and time performance. Patterns of language behaviors that people exhibited with readable labels and interview result  reveals AlphaRead let user achieve better satisfaction and using experiences.
											<p>
												<b>Research Methods: </b>lab study (2-by-2 factorial design), interview, task analysis, conversation analysis, questionnaires<br>
												<b>Tools: </b>Android, OpenCV for implementation, JMP for analysis

										By the trend of virtual reality devices, games move beyond our physical world provide user immersive gaming experience. SwitchSpace is a mixed reality room escape game designed to enable cross-reality interactions by mobile devices only. Players can take pictures of physical objects, then the objects will be transferred the objects into game once the objects are verified by human operators. Differed from following a fixed storyline in typical room escape game, tradition puzzle-based game are transformed into a creativity-enabled game to explore how players react and experience.
										<br><br><b>Result: </b>We identified several interesting themes, including flexibility of free-form gaming experience, game feasibility in public, and interests of group-based gaming among players. The study provides implications for future game designers to design interaction with not only surroundings but also group dynamics around when players are empowered to interact with environments they situated in.

										<p>
										This research is about exploring a better way to display the navigation instruction and find design implications to improve current system. Comparing to state-of-art system, we use different combinations of instructions, words, pictures to deliver instructions. And find which options would make users have better performance, be safer and memorize more pass-by intersections.

										<p>
										The design project was done in the period of taking Design Interactive System I in RWTH Aachen University.  We design a learning app for children in elementary school who cannot control theirselves very well. Children have to unlock their mobile devices for leisure by doing questions. And parents or teachers can monitor the progress of children’s learning condition by using monitoring app. We expect by delaying  children’s gratification of gaming, they would be motivated to learn because want to be rewarded.<br> The project got score 1.0 (top three) from all 24 groups.<br>
										<p>
											<b>Design Methods: </b>Brainstorming, user observations, persona, paper prototype, software prototype, video prototype <br>
											<b>Tools: </b>Balsamiq for software prototype
